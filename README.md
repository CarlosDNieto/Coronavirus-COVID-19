# Coronavirus COVID-19 repository

The notebook **Coronavirus Global Visualizations and Information** is where I make an analysis of the pandemic situation. 

> **IMPORTANT:** The visualizations are made with plotly and github doesn't support plotly figures yet, so in order to see the visualizations please go to my [kaggle notebook]() with this same jupyter notebook.
